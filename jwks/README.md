# JWKS at the Akamai Edge

**DISCLAIMER: This code is designed to be used as an example only. No guarantees are made that it's fit for purpose. It's not production ready and should not be used to protect critical resources**

This example can be used to verifiy a JSON WebToken. To verify the token the public certificate will be retrieved from an external location.

The documentation of this example is not ready yet.

The code is based on the JWT authentication example in the [Akamai edgeworker-examples repository](https://github.com/akamai/edgeworkers-examples/tree/master/edgecompute/examples/authentication/jwt)
